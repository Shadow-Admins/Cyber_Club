<H3>GTFOBins</H3>
<p>
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.
</p>
<p>
The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that this is not a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.
