For the walkthroughs found bellow I will first run through the challenges using GDB/Ghidra followed by how to use R2 (Radare2) to do the challenge. As this is an introduction its important for you to find a tool that you like as you continue to learn RE. Note there are many other tools that you can use for RE these are just three that I will demonstrate.

<H2>Getting Set Up</H2>
<details>
    <summary></summary>
<p></p>
The first thing we will go through is ensuring we have the tools we need to carry out the challenges.
<p></p>
To start with we will install Ghidra (new releases of Kali linux come with Ghidra pre installed)
<p></p>
<H3>Ghidra</H3> 
<p></p>
<a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" rel="nofollow">https://ghidra-sre.org/</a>
<p></p>
Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra extension components and/or scripts using Java or Python.
<p></p>
Navigating to the above site takes us to Ghidra's home page, from here we need to click on the "Download from GitHub" link.
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/ghidra_webpage.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
Clicking on this link takes us to the Ghidra GitHub "Releases" page, at the time of this write up you can see that the latest Ghidra version is '10.0.2'. From here you want to download the .zip file in my case 'ghidra_10.0.2_PUBLIC_20210804.zip'. (Whenever I install or download new tools I always use the '/opt' directory, this is actually what this directory is for.)
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/ghidra_releases.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
Now that you have downloaded the zip folder you can either use the GUI to unzip and extract the contents or use the command line:
<p></p>

```
unzip -d ghidra_10.0.2_PUBLIC_20210804.zip
```

<p></p>
Once you have extracted the folder you can 'cd' into the directory and you can see that there is a shell script called 'ghidraRun'. using the following command you can run Ghidra.
<p></p>

```
./ghidraRun
```

<p></p>
<H3>OPTIONAL: adding an alias so you can run Ghidra anywhere</H3>
<details>
    <summary></summary>
<p></p>
To add an alias so you can run ghidra from anywhere you will do the following.
<p></p>
Navigate to your home directory indicated by the <kbd>~</kbd> symbol (this can be easy done simply by entering <kbd>cd</kbd> with no directory listed).
Once you are in your home directory you need to list all files which can be done by entering <kbd>ls -a</kbd>. Depending on your flavour of linux you will see a fair few files (you can see my directory listing below).
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/home_directory.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
The file you are looking for is either '.zshrc' or '.bashrc' (your shell configuration files) depending on what you are currently using (hopefully you are using .zsh by now, if you would like to know the differences between the two shells check out this <a href="https://linuxhint.com/differences_between_bash_zsh/" rel="nofollow">site</a>. You can tell that my terminal probably looks significantly different to yours, thats because I am using Z shell with oh-my-zsh, p10k and colourls).
<p></p>
Once you have found the 'rc' file you need use a terminal editor (nano, vim) to edit it. I will use <kbd>nano</kbd> using the following command:
<p></p>

```
nano .zshrc
```

<p></p>
Now that we are editing the file we need to scroll until we find the 'alias' section. You can see mine bellow.
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/zshrc_alias.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
Now that you have found where your aliases are stored you need to add a line at the bottom, you can see my alias I have created but will be dependant on the version of ghidra you have.
<p></p>

```
alias ghidra='sudo /opt/<YOUR_GHIDRA_FOLDER>/ghidraRun'
```

<p></p>
Once you have entered this line you can exit and save .zshrc (if youre using nano the command is: <kbd>Ctrl+x</kbd> then <kbd>y</kbd> to save finally <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save as the current name '.zshrc')
<p></p>
Now that you have updated your '.zshrc' or '.bashrc' file you now need to tell your terminal to use this updated file as the 'source' we do this through the following command or by exiting your terminal and starting a new terminal.       ghidraRun 
<p></p>

```
source .zshrc
```

<p></p>
You have now sucessfully added a persistant alias to your shell config file. This alias will stay regardless of shutdown/restart unlike using command line to set a temporary alias.
<p></p>
Regardless of where you are located in your system now you can enter <kbd>ghidra</kbd> and it will run!
</details>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<H3>Radare2 (r2)</H3>
<p></p>
The next program we will install is Radare2 commonly known as 'r2'.
<p></p>
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/radareorg/radare2</a>
<p></p>
r2 is a rewrite from scratch of radare. It provies a set of libraries, tools and plugins to ease reverse engineering tasks.
<p></p>
The radare project started as a simple command-line hexadecimal editor focused on forensics, over time more features were added to support a scriptable command-line low level tool to edit from local hard drives, kernel memory, programs, remote gdb servers and be able to analyze, emulate, debug, modify and disassemble any binary.
<p></p>
Navigating to the above link will take you to the r2 GitHub page. Scrolling down you can see the install instructions.
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/radre2_github.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
This is an easy program to install. First we <kbd>cd /opt</kbd>, then we enter the listed commands:
<p></p>

```
git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
radare2/sys/install.sh
```

<p></p>
This will clone the git repository of r2 into your '/opt' directory then run the install script.
<p></p>
You have now installed r2, you can run it from anywhere by entering 'r2' into your command line.
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<H3>GDB</H3>
<p></p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" rel="nofollow">https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/</a>
<p></p>
The final program we will check to see if its intalled (if you're using linux it is likely already installed) and if it isnt we will go through the process of installing it.
<p></p>
To check if GDB is installed enter the following command:
<p></p>

```
# gdb
```

<p></p>
Which should output:
<p></p>

```
# gdb                                                                                                                                         ⇣5.97 KiB/s ⇡0.61 KiB/s 192.168.191.128   ─╯

```

<p></p>
Use <kbd>q</kbd> to exit GDB if it runs.
(note: you can see that my gdb command input says 'gef' thats because I have the 'gef' plugin installed) If you see an output like the one above, GDB is already installed and you dont need to do anything. If you get a return such as:
<p></p>

```
# gdb
zsh: command not found: gdb
```

<p></p>
You will need to install gdb, luckily this is very easy to do and can be done through the command line using the following commands:
<p></p>

```
$ sudo apt-get install libc6-dbg gdb valgrind 
```

<p></p>
Once that completes attempt to run GDB again and you should be ready to go!

    <summary>Crackme1</summary>
<p></p>
The first challenge we are given is:
<p></p>
Let's start with a basic warmup, can you run the binary?
<p></p>
What is the flag?
<p></p>
<details>
    <summary>Walkthrough</summary>
<p></p>
This challenge is simple, and is an introduction to 'file permissions' to start with if you are using the zip file I provided you need to unzip it, we do this in the command line using the following command:
<p></p>

```
unzip Reverse_ELF.zip
```

<p></p>
Once you have done this we use 'long list' to view the file permissions.
<p></p>

```
ls -l

```

<p></p>
The important thing to note is the first column which exaplins the file permissions of each file.
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/main/Starting_Point/Reversing/Challenges/Try_Hack_Me/Reversing_ELF/images/file-permission-syntax-explained.jpg"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
Here we can see that the files have read & write for the 'user' then read for 'group' and 'others. What we need to do is give execute permissions to to the crackme1 binary (we can go a step further and give execute permissions to all files at once) To do this we need to use the following command:
<p></p>

```
chmod +x crackme*
```

<p></p>
What this command is doing is adding the <kbd>x</kbd> flag, the <kbd>crackme*</kbd> is using the <kbd>*</kbd> wildcard to say apply this to everyfile starting with 'crackme' regardless of what comes after that ie. 1,2,3 etc. if you dont do it this way you can allow each binary to execute as you get to it ie <kbd>chmod +x crackme3</kbd>.
<p></p>
If we 'long list' again we can see the changes have occured.
<p></p>

```
ls -l
  rwxr-xr-x   1   parrot   parrot      7 KiB   Thu Sep  2 09:29:02 2021    crackme1

```

<p></p>
Now that we have made the binary executable we can run it using the following command.
<p></p>

```
./crackme1
flag{not_that_kind_of_elf}
```

<p></p>
Which prints the flag for us, giving us the answer.

The second challenge we are given is:
<p></p>
Find the super-secret password! and use it to obtain the flag
<p></p>
What is the super secret password?
<p></p>
What is the flag?
<p></p>
<details>
    <summary>Walkthrough</summary>
<p></p>
For this challenge we need to obtain 2 peices of information. This is still very early in the series and focuses on very basic things, to do this challenge we need to run strings on the program to see what strings of text are visable. But to start we will attempt to run the binary.
<p></p>

```
./crackme2
Usage: ./crackme2 password
```

<p></p>
We can see that the binary needs a password argument passed to it when its run, we can try this by passing 'test' to the binary.
<p></p>

```
./crackme2 test
Access denied.
```

<p></p>
Now we know how the binary functions we can start interogating it. To start we will run <kbd>strings</kbd> on the binary. You can see the output below.
<p></p>

This challenge is very much like the previous challenge with one slight twist. To start with we will attempt to run the binary.
<p></p>

<p></p>
You can see from the return that the binary needs an argument 'PASSWORD' passed to it. We can test this by passing 'test' to the binary.
<p></p>

```
./crackme3 test
Come on, even my aunt Mildred got this one!
```

<p></p>
Here we can see that we recieved a return but not the flag, we will run strings on the binary and see what is returned.

```

<p></p>
The top long string should look familiar (if you have done a few CTFs) this is base64, we can decode this in our terminal using the following command.
<p></p>

```
echo ZjByX3kwdXJfNWVjMG5kX2xlNTVvbl91bmJhc2U2NF80bGxfN2gzXzdoMW5nNQ== | base64 -d
f0r_y0ur_5ec0nd_le55on_unbase64_4ll_7h3_7h1ng5%
```

<p></p>
In this command we are echoing the base64 string so we can pass it using a pipe <kbd>|</kbd> into <kbd>base64 -d</kbd> which will decode the string.
<br>
We can now see if this will be accepted as the password.
<p></p>

```
./crackme3 f0r_y0ur_5ec0nd_le55on_unbase64_4ll_7h3_7h1ng5
Correct password!
```

<p></p>
We can see that the flag was accepted!

The fourth challenge we are given is:
<p></p>
Analyze and find the password for the binary?
<p></p>
What is the password?
<p></p>
<details>
    <summary>Walkthrough</summary>
<p></p>
This is the first challenge where we will start debugging and decompiling to get our answers. As I stated at the start I will walkthrough using GDB/Ghidra first followed by r2. To begin we will attempt to run the binary.
<p></p>

```
./crackme4
Usage : ./crackme4 password
This time the string is hidden and we used strcmp
```

<p></p>
We can see this binary takes and argument 'password' and we are also given a hint that 'the string is hidden using strcmp'
<p></p>
We can find out what the strcmp function does by using the <kbd>man strcmp</kbd> command, which returns:
<p></p>

```
STRCMP(3)                                                             Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                       STRCMP(3)

NAME
       strcmp, strncmp - compare two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into account (for a locale-aware comparison, see strcoll(3)).  The comparison is done using un‐
       signed characters.

       strcmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

       • 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

       • a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

       • a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.

       The strncmp() function is similar, except it compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than,  to
       match, or be greater than s2.

To start using GDB to debug the binary we use the following command:
<p></p>

```
gdb crackme4
```

Now that we have the binary loaded with gdb the first thing we want to do is list the functions of the binary, functions are sets of 'instructions' the binary uses to run. To show the functions in gdb we use the following command:
<p></p>

```
info func
```

<p></p>
'func' is short for functions (which can also be used), this command outputs:
<p></p>
