Is well known that hackers like to hide data in PNG files, but is hard to know how they are ciphering it unless hacker tools got leaked in the DarkWeb :), if you have it in hands you have half of the work done to reverse things, but maybe it is not so clear.

You have a ciphered image file, this was ciphered using that leaked binary file, what the hackers are hiding?.
