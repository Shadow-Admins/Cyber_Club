As threat actors become more sophisticated, they realize that rolling their own crypto is neither
efficient, nor effective. They will start to consider using well-known cryptographic algorithms
that have been well-tested and proven to be hard to break. Of course, key management then becomes
... key ... to maintaining operational security.
<p></p>
The pcap from this challenge is from a trojan that encrypts some of its communications, including
the files that it exfiltrates to the C2 server. You won't be able to crack the crypto, even if
you have a supercomputer. But maybe you won't have to... .
<p></p>
Extract the necessary data from the pcap, and decrypt the encrypted message, which includes the
flag.
