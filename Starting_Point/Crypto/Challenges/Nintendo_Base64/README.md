Aliens are trying to cause great misery for the human race by using our own cryptographic technology to encrypt all our games.
Fortunately, the aliens haven't played CryptoHack so they're making several noob mistakes. Therefore they've given us a chance to recover our games and find their flags.
They've tried to scramble data on an N64 but don't seem to understand that encoding and ASCII art are not valid types of encryption!
