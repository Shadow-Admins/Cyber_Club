A colleague of yours while tasked with keeping a flag safe, took a photo of it and encrypted it.
Once they encrypted it, they realized that:
<p></p>
1) The decryption part of the program hadn't been fully written
<br>
2) And even if it had been, all that they could remember of the password was that it was very long and complex
<p></p>
Recover the flag from the encrypted image
