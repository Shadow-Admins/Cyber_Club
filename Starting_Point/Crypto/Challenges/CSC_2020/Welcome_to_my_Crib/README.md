We have intercepted encrypted communications between actors. From previous
behaviour analysis, we found that all messages were encrypted using a repeating
shared 16 byte XOR key, and the first two messages were testing whether the channel
is stable, and consisted of common lowercase English words separated by a space.
We may know at least some of the ciphertext. Figure out how to recover the last
message, which consists of only the flag.
