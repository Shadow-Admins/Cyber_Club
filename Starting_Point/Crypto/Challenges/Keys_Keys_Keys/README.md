The flag file has been encrypted. (flag.txt.enc)
<p></p>
A password protected private key (private.pem) has been used to encrypt the symetric key
(key.bin.enc) that protects the flag file (flag.txt.enc).
<p></p>
Use the password specifications to obtain the password for the private key, to decrypt the
symmetric key, and finally obtain the flag.
<p></p>
The password follows the following conventions.
<br>
  -The password is 5 characters long.
<br>
  -The first character is upper case.
<br>
  -The second character is lower case.
<br>
  -The third character is the special character ^
<br>
  -The last two characters are numbers.
<p></p>
This flag format is slightly different. If the flag you find is this_is_a_flag, then the submitted
flag will be {flag}this_is_a_flag.
