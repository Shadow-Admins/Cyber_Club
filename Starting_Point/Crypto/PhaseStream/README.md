    <Summary>PhaseStream 1</summary>
<p></p>
The aliens are trying to build a secure cipher to encrypt all our games called "PhaseStream". They've heard that stream ciphers are pretty good. The aliens have learned of the XOR operation which is used to encrypt a plaintext with a key. They believe that XOR using a repeated 5-byte key is enough to build a strong stream cipher. Such silly aliens! Here's a flag they encrypted this way earlier. Can you decrypt it (hint: what's the flag format?) 2e313f2702184c5a0b1e321205550e03261b094d5c171f56011904

    <Summary>PhaseStream 2</summary>
<p></p>
The aliens have learned of a new concept called "security by obscurity". Fortunately for us they think it is a great idea and not a description of a common mistake. We've intercepted some alien comms and think they are XORing flags with a single-byte key and hiding the result inside 9999 lines of random data, Can you find the flag?

    <Summary>PhaseStream 3</summary>
<p></p>
The aliens have learned the stupidity of their misunderstanding of Kerckhoffs's principle. Now they're going to use a well-known stream cipher (AES in CTR mode) with a strong key. And they'll happily give us poor humans the source because they're so confident it's secure!

    <Summary>PhaseStream 4</summary>
<p></p>
The aliens saw us break PhaseStream 3 and have proposed a quick fix to protect their new cipher.
