Samus needs our help! After a day of burning out her Arm Cannon, blasting Metroids and melting the Mother Brain, she's found her ship's maps have all been encrypted. Lucky for her, these aliens still don't know what they're doing and are trying to roll their own crypto. Can you recover the flag from their elliptic protocol?

<p></p>
Dropping a morph ball bomb, Samus cracked open the floor and dropped down into the guts of Phaaze. At the end of the tunnel is a locked chest containing the hyper beam upgrade. Samus found the encrypted key preserved in a ball of glowing biomass, but can't decode it. Help Samus capture the flag so she can eradicate the alien invasion once and for all.
