It seems the aliens might be living backwards in time, so now we're suddenly seeing completely different and older kinds of cipher too. The flag consists entirely of uppercase characters, and is of the form CHTB{SOMETHINGHERE}. You'll still have to insert the {} yourself.

With all the timey-wimey weirdness going on, I have no idea if the aliens encrypted this before or after the tetris game. All I know is that I want my games back! The flag consists entirely of uppercase characters, and is of the form CHTB{SOMETHINGHERE}. You'll still have to insert the {} yourself.
