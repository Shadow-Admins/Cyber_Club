Aliens are using a human facility as a storage unit. The owners of the facility said their access credentials stopped working, but it's based on Bluetooth LE. We managed to install a Bluetooth LE sniffer close to the entrance, and captured some packets. Can you manage to get the access credentials from this capture?
