<H2>What is volatility?</H2>
<p>
Volatility is an extremely powerful program that allows us to analyse runtime state of a system using the data found in volatile storage (RAM). 
<br>
Volatility is one of the best open source software programs for analyzing RAM in 32 bit/64 bit systems. It supports analysis for Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android systems. It is based on Python and can be run on Windows, Linux, and Mac systems. It can analyze raw dumps, crash dumps, VMware dumps (.vmem), virtual box dumps, and many others.
</p>
<H2>Where do I Start?</H2>
Volatility has a ton of options (flags) that can be used and can be overwhelming at the start.
But once you work out a general road-map you can work through an analysis methodically. Once you have your initial foothold you can start searching for the information you need.
<H2>Getting your foothold</H2>
Assuming you already have a memory file (we will use 'bob.vmem' for this exercise as obtaining a memory file is another lesson) we need to identify what type of system (or profile) the memory is from.

```
sudo volatility -f bob.vmem imageinfo
```

Looking at this command we will unpack it and go through the basic syntax.
<br>
<kbd>sudo</kbd> we will be running the program as a root user.
<br>
<kbd>volatility</kbd> the program we want to run.
<br>
<kbd>-f bob.vmem</kbd> the <kbd>-f</kbd> flag points the program to the file we are looking to analyse.
<br>
<kbd>imageinfo</kbd> is the analysis option we want to use on the file.
<p>
    So what does this command give us?
