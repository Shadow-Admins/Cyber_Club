<H1>Mr Robot</H1>
<p></p>
<H2>What is it?</H2>
<p></p>
Mr Robot is a vulnerable VM that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/" rel="nofollow">VulnHub</a> so that you can host it locally or you can complete it on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot" rel="nofollow">TryHackMe</a>. Mr Robot is a free room on TryHackMe so anyone can do it without needing to subscribe (however I do strongly recommend subscribing to TryHackMe). The difference being that when you host the VM locally it will run faster and your brute forcing will occur quicker because you aren't tunneling through a VPN; however, you don't have the bonus of submitting the flags as you find them.
