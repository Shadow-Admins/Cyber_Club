<H2>What is it?</H2>
<p></p>
Mr Robot is a vulnerable VM that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/" rel="nofollow">VulnHub</a> so that you can host it locally or you can complete it on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot" rel="nofollow">TryHackMe</a>. The difference being that when you host the VM locally it will run faster and your brute forcing will occur quicker because you aren't tunneling through a VPN. You also don't have the bonus of submitting the flags as you find them.
