<p></p>
Basic Pentesting: 1 is a vulnerable VM that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/" rel="nofollow">VulnHub</a> so that you can host it locally. (To learn how to host this VM locally reference <a href="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/tree/main/Starting_Point/VulnHub" rel="nofollow">here</a>)

The first thing we need to do is identify the target VM on our network, (this is the mothod if you followed my guide for hosting the VM <a href="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/tree/main/Starting_Point/VulnHub" rel="nofollow">here</a>)
