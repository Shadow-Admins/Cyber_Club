<H1>Basic Pentesting: 1</H1>
<p></p>
<H2>What is it?</H2>
<p></p>
Basic Pentesting: 1 is a vulnerable VM that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/" rel="nofollow">VulnHub</a> so that you can host it locally. (To learn how to host this VM locally reference <a href="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/tree/main/Starting_Point/VulnHub" rel="nofollow">here</a>)
<p></p>
Basic Pentesting: 1 is an easy to intermediate box, it contains 1 flags (root flag) and has different ways of completing the box to achieve the same outcome. Doing this box you will cover the following areas:
<p></p>

```

<H5>Enumeration</H5>
- Network Scanning (Nmap)
<H5>Web Recon</H5>
- Recon (Nikto,gobuster,dirb,uniscan)
<br>
- Web directory traversal/file access
<H5>Breaking into a badly configured login page</H5>
- Setting up a dictionary file for username and password enumeration/cracking
<br>
- WordPress password cracking (wpscan,hydra)
<H5>Generating Backdoors</H5>
- Generate PHP Backdoor (Msfvenom)
<br>
- Using pre-configured php backdoor
<br>
- Upload and execute a backdoor
<H5>Catching the reverse conection on your host</H5>
- Reverse connection (Metasploit)
<H5>Identifying and cracking a hash</H5>
- Getting a hash and decrypting it
<H5>Getting a TTY shell</H5>
- Import python one-liner for proper TTY shell
<H5>Privilege Escalation</H5>
- One liner, linPEAS, linux-exploit-suggester-2
<br>
- binary, dirtycow

```


<p></p>
All flags have the following flag format:
<p></p>
key-1-of-3.txt
<br>
And when opened look like a random string of characters eg. ABCDENOASFINEAUINFAOPDSNFRUENPANFD
<p></p>
As stated before one flag is located on the website itself, one is located in the user folder and the final is located in the root folder.
<p></p>
I have written this write up as very beginner oriented with step-by-step walkthroughs to each stage of the process have a read you might learn something.

<p></p>
The first thing we need to do is identify the target VM on our network, (this is the mothod if you followed my guide for hosting the VM <a href="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/tree/main/Starting_Point/VulnHub" rel="nofollow">here</a>)
<p></p>
In order to do that we need to identify what our Attacking VMs network adapter. By using the following command:
<p></p>

```
sudo ifconfig
```

<p></p>
Which outputs:
<p></p>

```
❯ sudo ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.191.129  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.191.255

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

<p></p>
Here we can see the eth1 adapter, this is the adapter we added to the Host-only network. We will use the ip address given to this adapter to discover the Target VM on our network. We will use the following command:
<p></p>

```
nmap -e eth1 -T5 192.168.125.0/24
```

<p></p>
Looking at this command we used the <kbd>-e</kbd> flag to let nmap know which interface we want to use for the scan, the <kbd>-T5</kbd> flag tells nmap to do the fastest scan possible and the network we scanned against was the network we identified when we ran <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>.
<br>
This command returns:
<p></p>

```
❯ nmap -e eth1 -T5 192.168.125.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-11 12:40 AEST

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 19.50 seconds
```

<p></p>
Looking through the results we can identify our own ip address <kbd>192.168.125.134</kbd> and one other ip <kbd>192.168.125.135</kbd> we can therefore determine that the second ip is our target VM. Time for further enumeration with nmap. This time the command will look like this:
<p></p>

```
sudo nmap -e eth1 -A -vvv --script vuln -oN nmap.txt 192.168.125.135
```

<p></p>
For this command, we use the <kbd>-e</kbd> flag to direct nmap to our desired network interface, <kbd>-A</kbd> to run all scripts, <kbd>-vvv</kbd> to give very verbose output, <kbd>--script vuln</kbd> to run the vulnerability script against the machine, this is extremely helpful and does a lot of enumeration for us which we can see in the output, <kbd>-oN nmap.txt</kbd> outputs the scan to a text file se we can refer to it later and finally the ip address we wish to scan.
This command outputs the following:
<p></p>

```

```

<p></p>
What can we pull from this scan? We can see there are 3 ports open (port 21 running ftp, port 22 running ssh and port 80 running http) We can also see that the vuln script has enumerated a directory for us '/secret/'.
<p></p>
After doing these kinds of boxes a few times you will know that port 22 is rarely a way into the box so for now we will concentrate on the two other ports (21 and 80). (I am going to go over the process of gaining access via port 80 as this is the more difficult way to gain entry, I will cover getting in through port 21 after)
<p></p>
Prior to looking at these individually I will continue enumeration using some different tools. The first will be uniscan (one of my favourite tools).
<p></p>
Uniscan is a tool that comes prepackaged with both Parrot and kali, it has a simple GUI and is easy to use, you can find it here on Parrot.
<p></p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Shadow-Admins/Cyber_Club/blob/5b31f29ec8f6c04504fa101d14a1eb574bd9e3e5/Starting_Point/VulnHub/BasicPentesting1/images/uniscanloc.png"><br>
</div>
<p></p>
To use uniscan you enter the ip address you wish to scan and then check the options you want to use, I used the following options:
<br>
- Check Directory
<br>
- Check Files
<br>
- Check /robots.txt
<br>
- Dynamic tests
<br>
- Static tests
<br>
- Web Fingerprint
<br>
- Server Fingerprint
<p></p>
Uniscan creates a .html report in /usr/share/uniscan/reports/IPADDRESS.html
<p></p>
You can view this report by running:
<p></p>

```
firefox /usr/share/uniscan/reports/192.168.125.135 &
```

<p></p>
The report information (which you can view by clicking the 'open log file' button) is:

This provided us with a bit more information. It has enumerated a file for us and found 3 external hosts, it's interesting there is a reference to wordpress.

We will save this information for later, lets continue enumerating.
<p></p>
We will now use gobuster (gobuster -h displays the helpfile) to see if we can pick up anymore directories or files belonging to this website. The command we will use is:
<p></p>

```
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.125.135 -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt
```

<p></p>
In this command u can see we use the <kbd>dir</kbd> command followed by the <kbd>-u</kbd> command to point gobuster at the url, we then use the <kbd>-w</kbd> command to point gobuster to our desired wordlist. Here you can see I have used the raft-large-files.txt wordlist from <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists" rel="nofollow">SecLists</a>. (I strongly recommend downloading this git it contains tons of wordlists that can be used for multiple things)
<p></p>
This command outputs this:
<p></p>

Interesting another reference to wordpress, lets re-run gobuster but include the '/secret/' directory in the url. The command looks like this:
<p></p>

```
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.125.135/secret/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt
```

<p></p>
Which outputs:

They are only intended for use within a private context  and traffic that needs to cross the Internet will need to use a different, unique address.

Lets also run a quick niksto scan against these two sites. Nickto is a web vulnerability scanner you can view the help page by running 'nikto -H', The command will look like this:
<p></p>

```
nikto -h http://192.168.125.135 && nikto -h http://192.168.125.135/secret/
```

<p></p>
Notice the && between the two commands, this basically says run the first command then immediately run the second. THis outputs:
<p></p>

```
❯ nikto -h http://192.168.125.135 && nikto -h http://192.168.125.135/secret/
- Nikto v2.1.6
